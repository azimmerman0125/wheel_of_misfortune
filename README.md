# Wheel of Misfortune


I used this project to drive the brainstorming of incident handling in Infra/Security Teams.

You enter your scenario using JSON format in the file data/events.json with the format : 
- Category (will be displayed on the wheel) 
- Description of the misfortune

Open the index.html and spin the wheel ! 

Once the subject is decided you can brainstorm and detail your plan to deal with the specific problem highlighted
